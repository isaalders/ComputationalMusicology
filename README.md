# Corpus description
The corpus I'll be researching is a few albums made during the corona pandemic. I'll be comparing these to their previous albums and seeing how the songs have changed (I have not yet decided what I mean by "changed").

The artists and albums I chose to research are: 

- Taylor Swift (Folklore and Evermore)
- Ariana Grande (Positions)
- DeWolff (Wolffpack)

This interests me because ofcourse because of corona, a lot of artists are also stuck at home and bored. I'm curious too see if this overload of time and attention leads to different music. I will compare the songs on these albums released in the pandemic with songs on previous albums of the artist. I'm not entirely sure yet about the size of the corpus. Is it good to compare this for three artists or is is better to choose one?
